## Welcome to NTB45 aka KuudereEnthusiast's website

This website is being constructed

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
C
V
*Edit: seems like the ctrl key on my keyboard is not working
[Link](url) and ![Image]()
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/NTB45/why_is_it_not_working/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### How I made this

I got the domain name from freenom and set it to redirect at this page
originally this domain was going to be used for my nextcloud server but the mfers at jio blocked port forwarding
